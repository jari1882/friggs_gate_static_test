# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being supportive of fellow contributors and maintainers

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
* Sustained disruption of community spaces

## Project-Specific Standards

In addition to the general standards above, contributors to Frigg's Gate should:

* **Respect the cognitive architecture theme**: Maintain the mythical and technical metaphors that define the project's identity
* **Prioritize user experience**: Consider the impact of changes on end-users interacting with the cognitive system
* **Document architectural decisions**: Explain the reasoning behind significant technical choices
* **Test thoroughly**: Ensure changes don't break the cognitive flow or user interactions
* **Follow security best practices**: Protect user data and system integrity
* **Maintain code quality**: Write clean, understandable code that others can build upon

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to interactions related to:

* GitHub repositories and issue trackers
* Pull requests and code reviews  
* Documentation and wikis
* Community discussions and chat channels
* Project-related social media
* Conferences, meetups, and other events

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident and will take appropriate action to address the situation while protecting all parties involved.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by:

1. **Creating a private issue** on GitHub with the "code-of-conduct" label
2. **Contacting project maintainers** directly via email
3. **Using GitHub's report abuse feature** for serious violations

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information (if you're comfortable sharing it)
* Names of any other people involved or who witnessed the incident

## Confidentiality and Non-Retaliation
